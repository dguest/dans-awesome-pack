Dan's Awesome Pack
==================

This is a list of Dan-tools that you might find useful. They are
pretty bash-heavy because I like fast things and tab-complete. There
are also python scripts, but I don't like dependencies, so nothing in
here should depend on more than one library.

I try to push my neat C++ and python stuff into other places, maybe
I'll make a list of that somewhere else.

Anyway, this contains:

 - `git-fatlas`: A utility to help with sparse checkouts. It's better
   than the other ones, I swear.
 - `_h5ls`: tab complete for h5ls. It's cool, cause it's not slow. God
   ROOT is so slow...
 - `pandamonium`: check yer grid jobs from yer laptop!
 - `mark-and-jump`: super dumb wrapper on `pushd` and `popd`, for
   hopping between a few directories.

There's also a script to source all of them, it's called
`setup.sh`. You can source it to get all the things.
