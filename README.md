Dan's Awesome Pack
==================

This is a list of Dan-tools that you might find useful. They are
pretty bash-heavy because I like fast things and tab-complete. I don't
like dependencies, so nothing in here should depend on more than one
library.

Anyway, this contains:

 - `git-fatlas`: A utility to help with sparse checkouts. It's better
   than the other ones, I swear.
 - `_h5ls`: tab complete for h5ls. It's cool, cause it's not
   slow. ROOT is so slow...
 - `pandamonium`: check yer grid jobs from yer laptop!
 - `mark-and-jump`: super dumb wrapper on `pushd` and `popd`, for
   hopping between a few directories.
 - `rucio-replicators`: simple function to make rucio replication easier.
 - `git-tools`: misc git tools

There's also a script to source all of them, it's called
`setup.sh`. You can source it to get all the things.
